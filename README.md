# PasswordGenerator
Password Generator for Module 3 - JavaScript


## Description
The website is used for freely creating a password of the users choosing.  The user is able to enter the length that they'd like a password to be and then generate a password based on other simple prompts that come up.  

A free password is then randomly generated for the user.

I built the website as an exercise to help further my knowledge in JavaScript and to learn how to use JavaScript language to incorporate it with HTML and CSS.

While I was provided with the HTML and CSS, I did change some of it to make it a style that I preferred.  The JavaScript portion was written by me which showed me how to further utilize JavaScript to create websites.

Another prompt then appears where the user must decide if they'd like uppercase letters in their password.
A prompt then appears to ask the user if they'd like lowercase letters in their password.
